Hass.io allows anyone to create add-on repositories to easily share their add-ons for Hass.io. To try this locally, you can use our example add-on repository at `https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons-example`.

<p class='note warning'>
Home Assistant cannot guarantee the quality or security of third party add-ons. Use at your own risk.

From the Hass.io main panel open the add-on store.

Add the urls of repositories (one per line) and then press "Save". A new card for the repository will appear.

### {% linkable_title Help: Repository is not showing up %}

If you have added a repository but it's not showing up, it means that the repository contains invalid configuration. Go to the Hass.io panel -> Supervisor card -> View logs and scroll to the bottom. It should tell you what went wrong. Report this information to the repository author.
