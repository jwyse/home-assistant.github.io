[KNX/EIB](http://www.knx.org) integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to a KNX bus. The component requires a local KNX/IP interface like the [Weinzierl 730](http://www.weinzierl.de/index.php/en/all-knx/knx-devices-en/knx-ip-interface-730-en). Through this it will send and receive commands to and from other devices to the KNX bus.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor.knx)
- [Sensor](/components/sensor.knx)
- [Switch](/components/switch.knx)
- [Light](/components/light.knx)
- [Thermostat](/components/climate.knx)

A `knx` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml` file and contain the following options as required:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
```

- **host** (*Optional*): The IP address of the KNX/IP interface to use. It defaults to `0.0.0.0` which will start discovery for your KNX/IP gateway.
- **port** (*Optional*): The UDP port number. Defaults to `3671`.
