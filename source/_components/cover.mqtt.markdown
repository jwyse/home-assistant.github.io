The `mqtt` cover platform enables the possibility to control an MQTT cover. The device state will be updated only after receiving the a new
state from `state_topic`. If these messages are published with `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT device will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with correct state. Otherwise, the initial state will be `unknown`.

There is a state attribute that stores the relative position of the device, where 0 means the device is `closed` and all other intermediate positions means the device is `open`.

When a state topic is not available, the cover will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the cover will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the cover will wait for state confirmation from device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect cover operation.

To use your MQTT cover in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): The name of the sensor. Default is `MQTT Cover`.
- **state_topic** (*Optional*): The MQTT topic subscribed to receive sensor values.
- **command_topic** (*Required*): The MQTT topic to publish commands to control the rollershutter.
- **payload_open** (*Optional*): The payload that opens the cover. Default is `OPEN`.
- **payload_close** (*Optional*): The payload that closes the cover. Default is `CLOSE`.
- **payload_stop** (*Optional*):  The payload that stops the rollershutter. default is `STOP`.
- **state_open** (*Optional*): The payload that represents open state. Default is `open`.
- **state_closed** (*Optional*): The payload that represents closed state. Default is `closed`.
- **optimistic** (*Optional*): Flag that defines if switch works in optimistic mode. Default is `true` if no state topic defined, else `false`.
- **qos** (*Optional*): The maximum QoS level of the state topic. Default is `0`. Will also be used when publishing messages.
- **retain** (*Optional*): If the published message should have the retain flag on or not. Default is `false`.
- **value_template** (*Optional*): Defines a [template](/topics/templating/) to extract a value from the payload.
- **tilt_command_topic** (*Optional*): The MQTT topic to publish commands to control the cover tilt.
- **tilt_status_topic** (*Optional*): The MQTT topic subscribed to receive tilt status update values.
- **tilt_min** (*Optional*): The minimum tilt value. Default is `0`
- **tilt_max** (*Optional*): The maximum tilt value. Default is `100`
- **tilt_closed_value** (*Optional*): The value that will be sent on a `close_cover_tilt` command. Default is `0`
- **tilt_opened_value** (*Optional*): The value that will be sent on an `open_cover_tilt` command. Default is `100`
- **tilt_status_optimistic** (*Optional*): Flag that determines if tilt works in optimistic mode. Default is `true` if `tilt_status_topic` is not deinfed, else `false`
- **tilt_invert_state** (*Optional*): Flag that determines if open/close are flipped; higher values toward closed and lower values toward open. Default is `False`

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

In this section you find some real life examples of how to use this sensor.

### {% linkable_title Full configuration without tilt %}

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover without tilt.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "OPEN"
    state_closed: "STATE"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value.x }}{% endraw %}'
```

### {% linkable_title Full configuration %}

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "OPEN"
    state_closed: "STATE"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value.x }}{% endraw %}'
    tilt_command_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt'
    tilt_status_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt-status'
    tilt_min: 0
    tilt_max: 180
    tilt_closed_value: 70
    tilt_opened_value: 180
```

For a check you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your cover manually:

```bash
$  mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/cover/set -m "CLOSE"
```
