Groups allow the user to combine multiple entities into one. A group can be promoted to a **view** by setting `view: yes` under the group definition. This will make the group available as a new tab in the frontend.

Check the **Set State** <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-states-icon.png' class='no-shadow' height='38' /> page from the **Developer Tools** and browse the **Current entities:** listing for all available entities.

By default, every group appears in the HOME tab. If you create a group `default_view` it will REPLACE the contents of the HOME tab so you can customize the HOME tab as you wish.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
group:
  default_view:
    view: yes
    icon: mdi:home 
    entities:
      - group.kitchen
      - group.awesome_people
      - group.climate
  kitchen:
    name: Kitchen
    entities:
      - switch.kitchen_pin_3
  upstairs:
    name: Kids
    icon: mdi:account-multiple
    view: yes
    entities:
      - input_boolean.notify_home
      - camera.demo_camera
      - device_tracker.demo_paulus
      - group.garden
  climate:
    name: Climate
    view: no
    entities:
      - sensor.bedroom_temp
      - sensor.porch_temp
  awesome_people:
    name: Awesome People
    view: no
    entities:
      - device_tracker.dad_smith
      - device_tracker.mom_smith
```

Configuration variables:

- **view** (*Optional*): If yes then the entry will be shown as a view (tab) at the top.
- **name** (*Optional*): Name of the group.
- **icon** (*Optional*): If the group is a view, this icon will show at the top in the frontend instead of the name. If it's not a view, then the icon shows when this group is used in another group.
- **control** (*Optional*): If hidden then the group switch will be hidden.
- **entities** (*Required*): array or comma delimited string, list of entities to group.

If all entities in a group are switches or lights then Home Assistant adds a switch at the top of the card that turns them all on/off at once. If you want to hide this switch, set `control` to `hidden`.

You can create views (tabs) that contain other groups.
Notice in the example below that in order to refer to the group "Living Room", you use `group.living_room` (lowercase and spaces replaced with underscores).

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry that shows two groups, referred to in a view group (tab)
  Living Room:
    control: hidden
    entities:
      - light.light_family_1
      - binary_sensor.motion_living

  Bedroom: light.light_bedroom, switch.sleeping

  Rooms:
    view: yes
    name: Rooms
    entities:
      - group.living_room
      - group.bedroom
```
