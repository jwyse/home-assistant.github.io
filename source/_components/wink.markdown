[Wink](http://www.wink.com/) is a home automation hub that can control a whole wide range of devices on the market. Or, as they say in their own words:

<blockquote>
  Wink offers one, quick and simple way to connect people with the products they rely on every day in their home.
</blockquote>

Home Assistant integrates with the Wink API and allows you to get the status and control connected switches, lights, locks, fan, climate devices, covers, and sensors.

Check the related componets pages for actual devices that are support.

Home Assistant offers multiple ways to authenticate to the Wink API. Each authentication method is described below.

### Authentication with an access token.


To use this form of authentication obtain a token from the form below and insert it into your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
wink:
  access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Authentication with your Wink email and password.


This method uses the same form from above to obtain an access token, but does so without the user needing to manually do so.
This method pulls a new token on every startup of Home Assistant.

```yaml
wink:
  email: YOUR_WINK_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_WINK_PASSWORD
```

### Full oath authentication. (This is the best option!)


You can also request API access via Wink's [contact us](http://www.wink.com/help/contact/) page.

You will be provided with a client ID and a client secret via email. These can then be used in your configuration in place of the access_token this will prevent you from having to manually refresh your access token.

```yaml
wink:
  email: YOUR_WINK_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_WINK_PASSWORD
  client_id: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Configuration variables:

- **access_token** (*Required if the below aren't present.*): The retrieved access token.
- **email** (*Required if access token isn't provided*): Your Wink login email.
- **password** (*Required if access token isn't provided*): Your Wink login password.
- **client_id** (*Required if access token isn't provided*): Your provided Wink client_id.
- **client_secret** (*Required if access token isn't provided*): Your provided Wink client_secret.
- **user_agent** (*Optional*): The user-agent passed in the API calls to Wink.

This will connect to the Wink API and automatically set up any switches, lights, locks, fans, climate devices, covers, and sensors.

### {% linkable_title Service `refresh_state_from_wink` %}

The Wink component only obtains the device states from the Wink API once, during startup. All updates after that are pushed via a third party called PubNub. On rare occasions were an update isn't pushed device states can be out of sync. 

You can use the service wink/refresh_state_from_wink to pull the most recent state from the Wink API for all devices.

### {% linkable_title Service `add_new_devices` %}

You can use the service wink/add_new_devices to pull any newly paired Wink devices to an already running instance of Home-Assistant. Any new devices will also be added if Home-Assistant is restarted.

<p class='note'>
The Wink hub can only be accessed via the cloud. This means it requires an active internet connection and you will experience delays when controlling and updating devices (~3s).
