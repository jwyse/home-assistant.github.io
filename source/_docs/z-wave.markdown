[Z-Wave](http://www.z-wave.com/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control connected Z-Wave devices. Z-Wave support requires a [supported Z-Wave USB stick or module](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Controller-Compatibility-List) to be plugged into the host.

There is currently support for climate, covers, lights, locks, sensors, switches and thermostats. All will be picked up automatically after configuring this platform.

### {% linkable_title Installation %}

As of version 0.45, Home Assistant automatically installs python-openzwave from PyPI as needed.

There is one dependency you will need to have installed ahead of time:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zwave:
  usb_path: /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Configuration variables:

- **usb_path** (*Optional*): The port where your device is connected to your Home Assistant host.
- **config_path** (*Optional*): The path to the Python OpenZWave configuration files. Defaults to the 'config' that is installed by python-openzwave
- **autoheal** (*Optional*): Allows disabling auto Z-Wave heal at midnight. Defaults to True.
- **polling_interval** (*Optional*): The time period in milliseconds between polls of a nodes value. Be careful about using polling values below 30000 (30 seconds) as polling can flood the zwave network and cause problems.
- **device_config** (*Optional*): This attribute contains node-specific override values. (For releases prior to 0.39 this variable is called **customize**) See [Customizing devices and services](https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/customizing-devices/) for format:
  - **polling_intensity** (*Optional*): Enables polling of a value and sets the frequency of polling (0=none, 1=every time through the list, 2=every other time, etc). If not specified then your device will not be polled.
  - **ignored** (*Optional*): Ignore this entity completely. It won't be shown in the Web Interface and no events are generated for it.
  - **refresh_value** (*Optional*): Enable refreshing of the node value. Only the light component uses this. Defaults to False.
  - **delay** (*Optional*): Specify the delay for refreshing of node value. Only the light component uses this. Defaults to 2 seconds.
  - **invert_openclose_buttons** (*Optional*): Inverts function of the open and close buttons for the cover domain. Defaults to `False`.
- **debug** (*Optional*): Print verbose z-wave info to log. Defaults to `False`.

To find the path of your Z-Wave USB stick or module, run:

```bash
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

Or, on some other systems (such as Raspberry Pi), use:

```bash
$ ls /dev/ttyACM*

# If Home Assistant (`hass`) runs with another user (e.g. *homeassistant* on Hassbian) give access to the stick with:
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout homeassistant
```

Or, on some other systems (such as Pine 64), use:

```bash
$ ls /dev/ttyS*
```

Or, on macOS, use:

```bash
$ ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*
```

<p class='note'>
Depending on what's plugged into your USB ports, the name found above may change. You can lock in a name, such as `/dev/zwave`, by following [these instructions](http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/).

### {% linkable_title Adding Devices %}

To add a Z-Wave device to your system, go to the Services menu and select the `zwave` domain, and select the `add-node` service. Then find your device's add button and press that as well.

### {% linkable_title Adding Security Devices %}

Security Z-Wave devices require a network key before being added to the network using the `zwave.add_node_secure` service. You must edit the `options.xml` file, located in your `python-openzwave config_path` to use a network key before adding these devices.

Edit your `options.xml` file:

```bash
  <!-- <Option name="NetworkKey" value="0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0F 0x10" /> -->
```
Uncomment the line:
```bash
   <Option name="NetworkKey" value="0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0F, 0x10" />
```

You can replace these values with your own 16 byte network key. For more information on this process see the [OpenZwave](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave) wiki article [Adding Security Devices to OZW](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Adding-Security-Devices-to-OZW)

An easy script to generate a random key:
```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9A-F' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1 | sed -e 's/\(..\)/0x\1, /g'
```

### {% linkable_title Events %}

#### {% linkable_title zwave.network_complete %}

Home Assistant will trigger a event when the Z-Wave network is complete. Meaning all of the nodes on the network have been queried. This can take quite some time, depending on wakeup intervals on the battery powered devices on the network.

```yaml
 - alias: Z-Wave network is complete
   trigger:
     platform: event
     event_type: zwave.network_complete
```

#### {% linkable_title zwave.network_ready %}

Home Assistant will trigger a event when the Z-Wave network is ready for use. Between `zwave.network_start` and `zwave.network_ready` Home Assistant will feel sluggish when trying to send commands to Z-Wave nodes. This is because the controller is requesting information from all of the nodes on the network. When this is triggered all awake nodes have been queried and sleeping nodes will be queried when they awake.

```yaml
 - alias: Z-Wave network is ready
   trigger:
     platform: event
     event_type: zwave.network_ready
```

#### {% linkable_title zwave.network_start %}

Home Assistant will trigger a event when the Z-Wave network is set up to be started.

```yaml
 - alias: Z-Wave network is starting
   trigger:
     platform: event
     event_type: zwave.network_start
```

#### {% linkable_title zwave.network_stop %}

Home Assistant will trigger a event when the Z-Wave network stopping.

```yaml
 - alias: Z-Wave network is stopping
   trigger:
     platform: event
     event_type: zwave.network_stop
```

#### {% linkable_title zwave.node_event %}
Home Assistant will trigger a event when command_class_basic changes value on a node. This can be virtually anything, so tests have to be made to determine what value equals what. You can use this for automations.

Example:

```yaml
 - alias: Minimote Button Pressed
   trigger:
     platform: event
     event_type: zwave.node_event
     event_data:
       object_id: aeon_labs_minimote_1
       basic_level: 255
```

The *object_id* and *basic_level* of all triggered events can be seen in the console output.

#### {% linkable_title zwave.scene_activated %}

Some devices can also trigger scene activation events, which can be used in automation scripts (for example the press of a button on a wall switch):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation entry
automation:
  - alias: Turn on Desk light
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: zwave.scene_activated
      event_data:
        object_id: zwaveme_zme_wallcs_secure_wall_controller_8
        scene_id: 11
```

The *object_id* and *scene_id* of all triggered events can be seen in the console output.

### {% linkable_title Services %}

The `zwave` component exposes multiple services to help maintain the network.

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| add_node | Put the Z-Wave controller in inclusion mode. Allows one to add a new device to the Z-Wave network.|
| add_node_secure | Put the Z-Wave controller in secure inclusion mode. Allows one to add a new device with secure communications to the Z-Wave network. |
| cancel_command | Cancels a running Z-Wave command. If you have started a add_node or remove_node command, and decides you are not going to do it, then this must be used to stop the inclusion/exclusion command. |
| change_association | Add or remove an association in the Z-Wave network |
| heal_network | Tells the controller to "heal" the Z-Wave network. Basically asks the nodes to tell the controller all of their neighbors so the controller can refigure out optimal routing. |
| print_config_parameter | Prints Z-Wave node's config parameter value to the log. |
| print_node | Print all state of Z-Wave node. |
| refresh_entity| Refresh Z-Wave entity by refreshing dependent values.|
| refresh_node| Refresh Z-Wave node. |
| remove_node | Put the Z-Wave controller in exclusion mode. Allows one to remove a device from the Z-Wave network.|
| rename_node | Sets a node's name. Requires a `node_id` and `name` field. |
| remove_failed_node | Remove a failed node from the network. The Node should be on the Controllers Failed Node List, otherwise this command will fail.|
| replace_failed_node | Replace a failed device with another. If the node is not in the controller's failed nodes list, or the node responds, this command will fail.|
| reset_node_meters | Reset a node's meter values. Only works if the node supports this. |
| set_config_parameter | Let's the user set a config parameter to a node. |
| soft_reset | Tells the controller to do a "soft reset". This is not supposed to lose any data, but different controllers can behave differently to a "soft reset" command.|
| start_network | Starts the Z-Wave network.|
| stop_network | Stops the Z-Wave network.|
| test_network | Tells the controller to send no-op commands to each node and measure the time for a response. In theory, this can also bring back nodes which have been marked "presumed dead".|

The `soft_reset` and `heal_network` commands can be used as part of an automation script to help keep a Z-Wave network running reliably as shown in the example below.  By default, Home Assistant will run a `heal_network` at midnight.  This is a configuration option for the `zwave` component, the option defaults to `true` but can be disabled by setting `autoheal` to false.  Using the `soft_reset` function with some Z-Wave controllers can cause the Z-Wave network to hang. If you're having issues with your Z-Wave network try disabling this automation.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation entry
automation:
  - alias: soft reset at 2:30am
    trigger:
      platform: time
      after: '2:30:00'
    action:
      service: zwave.soft_reset

  - alias: heal at 2:31am
    trigger:
      platform: time
      after: '2:31:00'
    action:
      service: zwave.heal_network
```
